# Transposer
Transposes music 

Specify the key of the current instrument (eg. piano and flute are both in C Major, so type in C)

Specify the key of the new instrument (eg. clarinet is Bb, or Alto Sax is Eb, so type in either)

Specify the current key of the piece
 - doesn't actually change anything as it's often nicer to see the accidentals regardless
 - will then print out the new key of the piece
 
Finally, type in notes with 1 space between each; press enter and then it will transpose typed notes. Keep going until you 
type stop.

Rudimentary, but I'm proud and it helped me with all transposing I had to do for my pieces.
